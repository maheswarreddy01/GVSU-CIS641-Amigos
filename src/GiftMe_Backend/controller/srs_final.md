# Change management plan
Change management- When implementing change in a company, a change management strategy describes actions and roles for managing and controlling change. Businesses must continually incorporate change in order to prosper. Business must constantly evaluate and adapt what it offers to consumers, as well as how essential procedures are performed, who is responsible, and how improvement is accomplished. Because running a business may be a trial and error process, firms must be quick and nimble in their response to change in order to thrive
  
**How will you train people to use it?**

New requirements will necessitate changes in people's work habits, which can be challenging. Changes will be minimal in some circumstances but can be significant in others. To get started with, the workflow of the application must be clearly explained to all the stakeholders and all the potential problems which might arise while implementation must be addressed.
 At the unit level, it will be important to involve frontline staff and physicians as this will ensure improvement of procedures if needed.
  staff must be involved and be able to give suggestions on how to personalize the program for it to be a success. Proper management support and training resources will be provided for the staff to get more involved in the application use.
   Assist staff in fully accepting the new procedures and ensuring that they understand they offer promising ways for providing high-quality patient care. It is important to ensure that staff are aware of their responsibilities and that they have the necessary knowledge and resources to carry them out. Also, the staff will be guided and assisted the execution effort as the new practices are rolled out across the application to effectively manage the change process. Staff should be involved in defining challenges and testing solutions so that they feel ownership of the changes and see the potential for success.
  
  
**How will you ensure it integrates within their ecosystem / software?**

The data that is produced and added to this software can be helpful to integrate with the system that is used to manage hospitals. For example, the data of patients and doctors that oversee a certain patient help to maintain a record of the whole time the patient stays within the hospital and the medication taken place. The data collected through this system can be integrated into the management system of hospital to find the beds available, doctor shifts, average occupancy of the hospital and helps to assign vacated spots to new patients. This can overtake the other calendar and dashboard systems used by doctor's as the dashboard of the current application helps to keep track of daily tasks to go through and also help to maintain records of doctors attendance with every patient. The medication data present per patient helps the finance department and the medicinal store of the hospital to keep track of the patient's bill of materials used and also helps to upkeep their inventory of medicinal supplies thus also acting as a data source in terms of inventory. Thus, this system integration within the already existing software will reduce the burden of the employee and centralizes the whole system which can share and get the required data.

  
**How will you ensure that it any discovered issues are resolved?**

With the requirements taken, the developer shall have an idea of challenges that may arise during development and before the application goes into production. Most of the discovered issues shall be resolved by web testing, where before the website goes live and is accessible to the public, we tested it for potential flaws. Functionality, Security, Performance, which are the main testing activities that should be tested thoroughly. Functionality testing entails a variety of testing characteristics, including user interface, APIs, database testing, security, server testing, and fundamental website functionalities. Functional testing is quite handy since it allows users to do both manual and automated tests. It is carried out to check the functionality of each website attribute. We checked forms in the application and confirmed they are functioning normally. If a user does not input a necessary field, an error message will display. We made sure that the data submitted in forms to a database is linked to an email address. We checked Business flow from end to end which navigates the user through multiple web pages to finish the process. Performed negative testing as well, where a user takes an unexpected action, the web application displays the relevant error message. Website navigation was tested where buttons or links that navigate to different pages worked as expected. We verified that search engines can simply crawl our site by testing the HTML and CSS. The main component of the web application is a database, and it was tested thoroughly. Examined query response times and tuned them. Web application displayed the correct test data collected from the database. If any change management modification is requested from the client, After the team worked on the new changes the entire application shall be tested again from end to end to make sure no regression is impacted.
  

# Traceability links
Traceability is a type of requirements management that focuses on tracing needs that are clearly described in higher-level requirements but are required to achieve those requirements and make the whole system operate as planned.
